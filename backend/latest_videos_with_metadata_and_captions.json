          "description": "A controversial new aid distribution group backed by the US and Israel has begun working in Gaza.\n \nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said lorry loads of food had been delivered to secure sites and that it had begun distribution to people. It did not say where or how much aid had been handed out.\n \nThe group, which uses armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza, where experts are warning of a looming famine after an Israeli blockade that lasted 11 weeks.\n \nThe UN and many aid groups have refused to co-operate with GHF's plans, which they say contradict humanitarian principles and appear to \"weaponise aid\".\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#Gaza #Israel #US #BBCNews"

If you want to listen, just say \"Ask BBC Sounds to play Newscast”.

          "description": "Today we look at whether the government is about to row back on another policy - the two-child benefit cap.\n\nIt prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third child, with a few exemptions.\n\nSpeaking to Laura Kuenssberg this morning, the Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner refused to confirm whether it was going to be scrapped.\n\nRayner also responded to a story in The Telegraph this week, after the paper got hold of a document that suggests she’s is at odds with the chancellor over economic policy.\n\nAnd Laura, Paddy and Henry discuss how safe Kemi Badenoch is as leader of the opposition.\n\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker. If you want to listen, just say \"Ask BBC Sounds to play Newscast”. It works on most smart speakers.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

          "description": "As Israel eases its 11-week aid block, the UN has warned the aid getting in to Gaza is ‘nowhere near enough’, and that 2.1 million people remain at risk of famine.\n \nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said while almost 400 lorries were cleared for entry into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, supplies from only 115 have actually been collected.\n \nHe said Gaza is in the \"cruellest phase\" of the war, adding that \"more people will die\" without quick and ongoing access to aid.\n \nMeanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu attacked leaders of the UK, France and Canada and accused them of \"emboldening Hamas\" after their leaders criticised Israel for its ongoing military escalation and lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Israel #Gaza #BBCNews"

        "description": "A man has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after two Israeli embassy staff were shot dead in Washington DC on Wednesday night.\n\nSarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when they were attacked.\n\nElias Rodriguez, who is 30 and from Chicago, was detained at the scene. More charges could come later, law enforcement officials have said , and the FBI is investigating a “manifesto” said to have been written by the suspect.\n\nPolice say  Rodriguez was in town for a work conference.  He shouted “free Palestine”  after being taken into custody.\n\nUS President Trump said the attack was \"based obviously on antisemitism\", while DC Mayor Muriel Bowser says \"this crime will not be tolerated in our city”.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the leaders of France, the UK and Canada of fuelling antisemitism in a statement after the attack.  He said they were \"on the wrong side of humanity and history\" after they threatened \"concrete action\" against Israel this week if it continues its latest military operations in Gaza. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

          "description": "A man has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after two Israeli embassy staff were shot dead in Washington DC on Wednesday night.\n\nSarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when they were attacked.\n\nElias Rodriguez, who is 30 and from Chicago, was detained at the scene. More charges could come later, law enforcement officials have said , and the FBI is investigating a “manifesto” said to have been written by the suspect.\n\nPolice say  Rodriguez was in town for a work conference.  He shouted “free Palestine”  after being taken into custody.\n\nUS President Trump said the attack was \"based obviously on antisemitism\", while DC Mayor Muriel Bowser says \"this crime will not be tolerated in our city”.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the leaders of France, the UK and Canada of fuelling antisemitism in a statement after the attack.  He said they were \"on the wrong side of humanity and history\" after they threatened \"concrete action\" against Israel this week if it continues its latest military operations in Gaza. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

          "description": "After Donald Trump's two-hour call with Vladimir Putin on Monday failed to deliver substantial progress, European leaders made the decision to ramp up sanctions on their own.\n\nSo, with strong backing reported in the Senate for harsher action, could the US soon follow, and introduce heavier sanctions on Russia?\n\nFor this episode of Ukrainecast, Lucy Hockings is joined by Vitaly Shevchenko and Sumi Somaskanda in London, as well as James Waterhouse from Kyiv.\n\nTo hear more - including analysis of Russia's threat to Finland - listen to the full episode here: www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0lcv283\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #BBCNews"

        "description": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar has probably been killed in an airstrike in Gaza.   He’s the brother of the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last October. \n\nIn a news conference Netanyah struck a defiant tone in the face of international criticism, insisting that the entire Gaza Strip would be taken under Israeli security control and Hamas destroyed, in the latest Israeli military offensive. \n\nThe UK government has said that Israel is using hunger “as a weapon of war” in Gaza and the UN has said the territory is facing famine.   Palestinians there are still waiting for aid to arrive after Israel eased an 11-week blockade.  Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday but the UN says that's a small fraction of what's needed and its teams have not been able to distribute the aid. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
