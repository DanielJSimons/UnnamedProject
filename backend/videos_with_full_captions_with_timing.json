          "description": "The Spanish government is calling for an international arms embargo on the Israeli government to end the war and the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"We must all agree on a joint arms embargo,\" Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares told journalists at the start of an international meeting on the crisis in the Spanish capital. \"The last thing the Middle East needs right now is weapons.\"\n\nIsraeli airstrikes killed 30 Palestinians in the last 24 hours according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled health ministry. \n\nSmall quantities of aid have entered Gaza but only a small fraction of what is required to prevent mass starvation.  There   is desperate need for food, water and medicine, with Gaza’s youngest children the most vulnerable.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at ten reporting by Fergal Keane and Barbara Plett Usher.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

All these things are excuses for teams that don't win the league, and it's nice that if you have all these excuses, that you don't have to use them, but you still just won it.\"\n\nLiverpool secured the title without any serious strengthening of the squad Slot inherited, which he said made it \"probably even more special\".  And he drew comparisons with his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite an overhaul of his team.  \"I did it now in two different leagues and in two different ways.”\n\nRecently the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lamented how “red cards and injuries” had impacted on his team’s title bid.   Last season’s Premier League winners Manchester City cited similar problems with injuries to key players for the club’s failure to present a sustained challenge to Liverpool.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview conducted at the club's training ground before Liverpool's final match of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday, Slot also spoke of his \"hope” that Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a \"positive\" send-off, after he was booed by some fans following confirmation he will leave his boyhood club next month.\n\nSlot also said he would\"cherish for the rest of my life\" his team’s open bus parade through Liverpool to celebrate winning the title.\n\nHe disputed Arteta's argument that teams had to be in \"the right place at the right time\" to win the Premier League, suggesting that over a long and arduous season it was clear that the best team won.\n\nHe insisted he was \"not worried\" about the uncertainty that surrounded key players Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk before they signed contract extensions and said it would be \"stupid\" not to strengthen the squad this summer, although he admitted that the club may not be able to bring in the players they most want.\n\nJane Hill presents Arne Slot’s exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan.\n\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW ON BBC iPLAYER:\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0lcd7bv/premier-league-arne-slot-reflects-on-title-signings-and-partying-in-ibiza\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar has probably been killed in an airstrike in Gaza.   He’s the brother of the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last October. \n\nIn a news conference Netanyah struck a defiant tone in the face of international criticism, insisting that the entire Gaza Strip would be taken under Israeli security control and Hamas destroyed, in the latest Israeli military offensive. \n\nThe UK government has said that Israel is using hunger “as a weapon of war” in Gaza and the UN has said the territory is facing famine.   Palestinians there are still waiting for aid to arrive after Israel eased an 11-week blockade.  Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday but the UN says that's a small fraction of what's needed and its teams have not been able to distribute the aid. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
